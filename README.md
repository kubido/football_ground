Football Ground
================

An HTML template for Football Ground with Grid

## What is this??
The purpose I making this is for define user position in a formation numbers (1-11) increase from right to left (as viewed from the team’s goalkeeper’s point of view). 
the grid itself is a standard from stats.com, we use it to define the spesific player position in the ground and sent it as a json (there's a button for generate yaml string)  :)
